Next, I ran the command "python manage.py createsuperuser" which I created a new super user as the .env file explains with "me" as both the username and password and "me@me.me as the email.

Changed the states of "Every Night is Pizza Night", "The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science", and "On Tyranny" to a different status than available.
